## 📘 About This Project  

This project is a **menu-driven Banking Account Management System** built entirely in **C++**, implementing **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts such as **inheritance**, **polymorphism**, and **encapsulation**.

It simulates a small-scale banking environment where users can:  
- 💳 Create **Savings** or **Checking** accounts  
- 💰 Perform **Deposit** and **Withdraw** operations  
- 📈 **Accumulate interest** for savings accounts  
- 📋 View **account details** in real time  

> 🧠 *The goal is to strengthen my C++ fundamentals and build systems that reflect real-world financial logic — a step toward low-latency and quant development.*

---

## 🔥 Motivation  

I am deeply interested in **low-latency financial systems**, **quantitative trading infrastructure**, and **C++ performance engineering**.  
Through this project, I’m learning to:  

✅ Write clean, extensible **C++ code**  
✅ Use **virtual functions and dynamic dispatch** effectively  
✅ Represent **core banking logic** (balance updates, rate accumulation) using OOP principles  
✅ Build a foundation for **order-matching engines**, **backtesting frameworks**, and **HFT trading simulators**

> 💭 This project is a small but meaningful step toward becoming a **Quant C++ Developer** capable of designing **efficient, high-performance systems**.

---

## 🧩 Features  

✨ Menu-driven console interface  
🏦 Supports **Savings** and **Checking** account creation  
💸 Implements **Deposit**, **Withdraw**, and **Interest Accumulation**  
🧱 Enforces **minimum balance** rules for Checking accounts  
🔁 Demonstrates **runtime polymorphism** using base-class pointers  
🧩 Clean separation using **header and source files**

---

## 🧠 Concepts Used  

- 🧱 **Classes & Objects**  
- 🔗 **Inheritance & Polymorphism**  
- 🌀 **Virtual Functions & Overriding**  
- 🔢 **Static Data Members** (Account Number Generation)  
- 🔒 **Encapsulation** (Data Hiding)  
- 🧹 **Dynamic Memory Management**

## ⚙️ How to Run  

1️⃣ Open the project in your favorite **C++ IDE** (Visual Studio / Code::Blocks / CLion).  
2️⃣ Build all `.cpp` files together.  
3️⃣ Run the program — a **menu** will appear in the console.  
4️⃣ Follow the prompts to create an account and perform transactions interactively.

## 💡 Personal Note  

> I’m passionate about **C++**, **financial engineering**, and **quantitative systems design**.  
> This project is part of my journey toward mastering **low-latency programming** and understanding how **real-world trading and banking systems** are built.
